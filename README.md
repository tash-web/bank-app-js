# Hi everyone,

This is a part of me learning [Web Dev For Beginners](https://microsoft.github.io/Web-Dev-For-Beginners/#/) by Microsoft. All the materials that I used to create are provided by them.

## The Project

I learn how create a bank app without any frameworks. It is deep dive on JavaScript capability and JavaScript alone is amazing. The styles are provide by me.

## The Obstacle

Figure out how the flows work. This is more deep dive on JavaScript. I barely use any of the semantic that has been explained in the lesson like `[Object.freeze()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze)`, the difference between `LocalStorage` and `sessionStorage`, what is `encodeURIComponent()`, and many more.

Also, It's help me to understand more about API. In here, they teach us how to use `async/await` correctly and avoid errors. It's priceless.

## The Results

I enjoyed made them. I love how they allowed us to style the app. Even tough, it is a robust js app, but they still remind us about accessibility.

#### Note to myself

- update dashboard style
